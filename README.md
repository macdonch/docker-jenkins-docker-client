# Jenkins Docker Image including the docker client
This docker image includes the docker command to enable Jenkins to interact with a docker daemon.

It is a copy of https://github.com/trion-development/docker-jenkins-docker-client

It has been modified to include a daemon.json file so insecure regristries can be added.
